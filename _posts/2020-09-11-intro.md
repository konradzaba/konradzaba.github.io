Hello! Nice to meet you stranger :)

Last week I had my birthday and I've decided to start doing something positive - since I use many tutorials on Web so often, now it's my time to contribute.

You will find here solutions to random non-obvious problems I tackled, things that I would like to share with the Internet as well as some occasional ramblings. At work I'm dealing mostly with software architecture, .NET and GIS programming. In my spare time I like to program 3D engines in .NET using [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) (XNA) and Xamarin frameworks especially for Android.

I hope you will find here something worthwhile!
